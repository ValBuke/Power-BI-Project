# Overview

The project entails creating visualizations to represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs.
Identifying and discussing potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.


# Data


The HR data encompasses a range of variables that detail employee demographics, job progression, and performance over fiscal years. It includes unique identifiers like Employee ID and tracks attributes such as Gender, Age, and Nationality. 
Key indicators include whether employees were new hires in FY20 or left in that year, their performance ratings for FY20 and FY19, and their promotion status for FY20 and FY21. 
The dataset also records departmental assignments as of July 1, 2020, job levels before and after promotions, and employment type (e.g., full-time, part-time). 
Additionally, it includes data on the base groups considered for promotions and turnover, time in job levels, and PRA (Performance Review Assessment) status by department and job level group.
The data provides insights into employee movement, departmental changes, and performance metrics crucial for organizational analysis and decision-making.

# Key Insights

### Performance Ratings
There is evidence of gender disparities in performance ratings.
Male employees have higher ratings than their female counterparts.


### Executive Gender Balance
There is no gender balance in executive roles.
Women are underrepresented.

### Age Group Analysis
Young employees (between 30 to 39) are underrepresented in executive roles.

# Recommendations
1.Ensure fairness in the performance evaluation processes. Implement measures to ensure that performance evaluations are fair and unbiased, including regular reviews of rating patterns across genders.
2.Implement targeted recruitment strategies to increase the number of women in the talent pipeline for executive roles.
3.Develop leadership programs specifically designed to prepare women for executive positions.
4.Create policies that support a diverse range of age groups and ensure that age does not become a barrier to career advancement.
5.Encourage mentorship programs that bring together different age groups to support career development and knowledge transfer.
6. Set clear targets for gender diversity in executive roles and track progress against these targets
